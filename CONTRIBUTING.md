# Contributing Guide

Whether you plan on implementing a new feature, improving documentation, providing guidance, reporting a bug, or contributing in another way, thank you for investing your time in contributing to this project! In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow including opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR. While I know Java well, I do not have experience with the Java Native Interface beyond this project, so the quality assurance will depend on experts in this open-source community and testing to make sure that the functionality does what it aims to do. 

## Types of Contributions

**For documentation improvements** simply open a pull request with the documentation additions or changes with a brief summary of what you updated. 

**For features** Open a new issue _only if no issue and no pull request exists for that feature_. Be sure to search the existing issues. 

**For bug fixes and reports** Open an issue, and feel free to assign yourself to the issue and begin working on it.

## Forking

Forking the repository is welcome in order to make using Convex in Java easier for developers.
